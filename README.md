## How to Use

### Instant Web Use
Simply click the link above - the simulator runs directly in your browser!

### Local Setup
1. **Clone the project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/staviv/radon-transform-simulator.git
   cd radon-transform-simulator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in browser**: `http://localhost:3000`

### Using the Simulator

#### Adding Shapes
1. Select a shape type from the left panel (ellipse/rectangle/triangle/star)
2. Click on the left canvas where you want to place it
3. Drag without releasing to determine size and shape
4. Release to finish creating the shape

#### Editing Shapes
- **Select**: Click on an existing shape
- **Move**: Drag selected shape
- **Rotate**: Ctrl + drag
- **Add over existing**: Shift + click
- **Resize**: Use size/width/height sliders
- **Intensity**: Adjust with intensity slider
- **Delete**: Select shape and press Delete
- **Undo/Redo**: Ctrl+Z/Y

#### Viewing Results
- Right canvas displays the Radon Transform
- X-axis represents angles (0-180 degrees)  
- Y-axis represents distances (-œÅmax to œÅmax)

## Understanding the Radon Transform

The Radon Transform is used in medical imaging (CT scans), image processing, and computer vision. It creates projections of images at different angles, helping detect lines and shapes.

## Technical Details

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and modern CSS. Features real-time computation, responsive design, and Hebrew RTL interface.
