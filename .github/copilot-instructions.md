# Radon Transform Simulator Instructions

This is a JavaScript-based Radon Transform simulator project that provides an interactive visualization tool.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file with Hebrew interface
- `style.css` - Modern, responsive styling with grid layout
- `app.js` - Main application logic and user interaction handling
- `radon-transform.js` - Core Radon Transform mathematical implementation

## Key Features
- Interactive shape creation (circle, rectangle, triangle)
- Real-time Radon Transform visualization
- Shape manipulation (move, rotate, resize, intensity)
- Hebrew RTL interface
- Responsive design for multiple screen sizes

## Development Guidelines
- Keep mathematical accuracy in Radon Transform calculations
- Maintain smooth real-time updates for good user experience
- Follow Hebrew RTL text direction in UI elements
- Use modern CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility with vanilla JavaScript
- Optimize canvas rendering for performance

## Code Style
- Use ES6+ features and classes
- Comment complex mathematical operations in Hebrew when relevant
- Maintain clean separation between UI logic and mathematical computations
- Use semantic HTML and accessible design patterns
